# Dynamic Ensemble Selection based on Algorithm Shapley (DES-AS)
Dynamic Ennsemble Selection Based On Algorithm Shapley (DES-AS) is a novel Ensemble Learning approach in which Algorithm Shapley, a variant of Shapley value in the game theory, is used to select the contributary classifiers for each query sample dynamically!

The proposed framework can fairly distribute contributions to each classifiers

The paper discussing this framework is available [DES-AS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320324006502?via%3Dihub)

This framework has been developed utilizing the [DESlib library](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/DESlib), a powerful resource for dynamic selection in Python. Our repository offers a straightforward experiment designed to evaluate the performance of our proposed approach against the dynamic selection (DS) techniques already implemented within the DESlib library. To facilitate this comparison, users can easily download the repository and execute the mainExperiment.py file, which will conduct the experiment and provide the necessary results for analysis.
