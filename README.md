# DES-AS
Dynamic Ennsemble Selection Based On Algorithm Shapley (DES-AS) is a novel Ensemble Learning approach in which Algorithm Shapley, a variant of Shapley value in the game theory, is used to fairly evaluate the contribution of each classifier and select the contributary classifiers for each query sample dynamically!
