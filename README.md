# Dynamic Ensemble Selection based on Algorithm Shapley (DES-AS)
Dynamic Ensemble Selection Based On Algorithm Shapley (DES-AS) represents a novel Ensemble Learning approach, wherein a variant of the Shapley value from game theory, known as Algorithm Shapley, is employed to dynamically select the most contributory classifiers for each query sample. The paper discussing this framework is available [DES-AS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320324006502?via%3Dihub).

This framework has been developed utilizing the [DESlib library](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/DESlib), a powerful resource for dynamic selection in Python. Our repository offers a straightforward experiment designed to evaluate the performance of our proposed approach against the dynamic selection (DS) techniques already implemented within the DESlib library. To facilitate this comparison, users can easily download the repository and execute .py files in large_scale_experiment file, which will conduct the experiment and provide the necessary results for analysis.
