# Dynamic Ensemble Selection based on Algorithm Shapley (DES-AS)
Dynamic Ennsemble Selection Based On Algorithm Shapley (DES-AS) is a novel Ensemble Learning approach in which Algorithm Shapley, a variant of Shapley value in the game theory, is used to select the contributary classifiers for each query sample dynamically!

The proposed framework can fairly distribute contributions to each classifiers

This framework has been implemented based on [DESlib library](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/DESlib) in Python language. This repository provides a simple experiment to compare the performance of the proposed approach with the implemented DS approaches in the DESlib library. To conduct this experiment, simply download the repository and run the mainExperiment.py file.
